          We use the latest in lap timing equipment, our system is a computerized fully automated lap scoring system which enables us to control races properly and give you the results you want.
          <br>
          The timing system we use is the same as that used by professional race tracks around the world.
          <br>
          After your race on the track you can expect to see the following from our system:
          <ul>
            <li>Finishing positions.</li>
            <li>How much each team trailed the winning team by.</li>
            <li>Fastest lap of the race.</li>
            <li>In which lap the fastest time what done in.</li>
            <li>Number of laps completed by each person/team.</li>
            <li>Total racing time.</li>
          </ul>
          And there is a whole lot more information that we are able to extract from you system.
